# SoCloseYetSoFar
A tricky 2D puzzle/platformer game

Game created during at the Toulouse Antenna of the 2015 Global Game Jam.

The theme of the game jam was : "What do we do now ?"

We chose to make a simple game 2D like mario, but when the player reach the end, nothing happen, and he has to search deeper to find something else to do.
And then, we repeated this process each time the player though he won, throuh different levels.

The game is quite simple.
We design the map with the softare Tiles, then used the JSon to create them with some hand-maded sprite in Unity.
Then, from one level to another, we just had to make some minor changes to the main level.

Due to a lack of time, we got no time to integrate sound in this game.
